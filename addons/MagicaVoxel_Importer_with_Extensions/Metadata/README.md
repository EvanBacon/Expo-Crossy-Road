Imports MagicaVoxel .vox files as meshes. Supports most node extensions, allowing multiple models and complex scene graphs.

This works with Godot 3.1 and includes import scaling option, correct coordinate system translation, multiple models,
and complex scene graphs (you can group, rotate, flip, and translate nodes in the world. Even reference copies work!)
